# Reshade for UWP
![Badge of how many times this project has been downloaded](https://shields.io/github/downloads/MilkyDeveloper/ReshadeForUWP/total)
![Actively Maintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintenance%20Level-Actively%20Maintained-green.svg)

An awesome GUI wrapper that injects Reshade in UWP apps and games. It also supports Xbox Game Pass PC and Microsoft Store games. *Note: Despite the edit dates, this project is still **maintained**, just not actively developed because I feel content with the current state of the software. If bugs and feature requests arise, I'll implement them.*

## Installation

Just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/MilkyDeveloper/ReshadeForUWP/releases/) to install Reshade for UWP. It's a portable/bundled exe so there's no setup required whatsoever!

### EA Play

For the new Xbox Game Pass EA Play integration, all you need to do is use Reshade normally. These games are not UWP, and the "*EA Play for Game Pass*" game entries are just a frontend for the EA Play Desktop program.

## Usage

## Limitations

* You might have some trouble getting this to work on games that are not on Steam due to the different, weird game engines that games like Minecraft Windows 10 Edition and Forza Horizon 4 may have.
> **Flight Sim 2020, Forza games, and Minecraft Windows 10 Edition (Dungeons will work because it's using Unreal Engine 4) are known not to work due to this.**
* Depth buffer isn't tested **yet**. It's for-sure what I'm going to test next after I get some games downloaded to test.
* You tell me in the Github Issues tab!

## License

Naturally, because Reshade is awesome (and open source!), and given the fact I love the MIT License, that's what I set it to. Just be aware of the work that was put into the making of this project and basic human ethics.
